## Multiple Blank Lines

Put together a simple-as-possible Rails app ([entries-rails](https://github.com/smiller/entries-rails)) so that I had a frame for a page which intermittently polled a textarea and updated the html output accordingly.

Talking of the simplest thing that could possibly work:

```javascript
function buildPreview(){
  $.post("/preview", { textin: $("#textin").val() },  function(data) {
    $("#textout").empty();
    $("#textout").append($.parseHTML(data.textout))
    setTimeout(buildPreview,10000);
  });
}

buildPreview();
```

One thing that experimenting with different kinds of entries in the result revealed is that multiple blank lines break the formatter:

```ruby
NoMethodError (undefined method `indent' for nil:NilClass):
  lib/html_formatter.rb:13:in `format_paragraph'
  lib/html_formatter.rb:7:in `block in format'
  lib/html_formatter.rb:7:in `collect'
  lib/html_formatter.rb:7:in `format'
  app/controllers/entries_controller.rb:11:in `preview'
```

So let’s go back to the [entries](https://github.com/smiller/entries) project and add a failing test for that / decide how to fix that.  Even if we do make it a rule that the EntryBuilder won’t create multiple blank lines – which we probably will – the HtmlFormatter shouldn’t fall over if one slips through.  So we add a spec:

```ruby
# spec/html_formatter_spec.rb
context "doesn't choke on multiple blank lines" do
  it "copes" do
    f = HtmlFormatter.new(Entry.new([Line.new("mind the gap..."),
                                     Line.new(""),
                                     Line.new(""),
                                     Line.new("... safely stowed")]))
    expect(f.format).to eq("<p>mind the gap...</p><p>... safely stowed</p>")
  end
end
```

and watch it fail:

```ruby
Failures:

  1) HtmlFormatter#format doesn't choke on multiple blank lines copes
     Failure/Error: expect(f.format).to eq("<p>mind the gap...</p><p>... safely stowed</p>")
     NoMethodError:
       undefined method `indent' for nil:NilClass
     # ./lib/html_formatter.rb:13:in `format_paragraph'
     # ./lib/html_formatter.rb:7:in `block in format'
     # ./lib/html_formatter.rb:7:in `collect'
     # ./lib/html_formatter.rb:7:in `format'
     # ./spec/html_formatter_spec.rb:68:in `block (3 levels) in <top (required)>'
```

And then go look at the code, and realize that if `Entry#paragraphs` didn’t return multiple blank lines it wouldn’t, and we’ve six minutes to go so rather than writing an inner test for `Entry#paragraphs`, which would be the better if less rushed approach, we just write code in `#paragraphs` that makes the outer test pass:

```ruby
def paragraphs
  return [] if @lines.count == 0
  @lines.inject([[]]) do |result, line|
    build_next_result(result, line)
  end
end

private

def build_next_result(result, line)
  unless second_blank_line(result, line)
    line.text == "" ? result << [] : result.last << line
  end
  result
end

def second_blank_line(result, line)
  line.text == "" && result.last == []
end
```

And now we have passing tests and a refactoring cycle to do.  (Maybe the guard code should go on the initializer?  On the other hand, if there is bad data in the database, we still want to catch it before `#paragraphs` passes it up to the HtmlFormatter, so we probably want it here too, at the least.

(Having pushed that change also up into entry-rails, can confirm that it no longer breaks in the UI either.  So that’s the immediate crisis sorted.)

## But with World Enough, and Time…

There are two more things I’d like to do here.  One is write a unit test for `Entry#paragraphs`, so we’re testing at the level of the `#paragraphs` method (and not of the method `#paragraphs` is outputting to) that it doesn’t blow up on a second blank line.  Second is add a test to `EntryBuilder#build` to make sure it doesn’t pass through the second empty blank line to start with.

So:

```ruby
# spec/entry_spec.rb
context "two paras with two blank lines" do
  it "returns two paras" do
    first = [Line.new("mind the gap...")]
    blank = Line.new("")
    second = [Line.new("... safely stowed")]
    entry = Entry.new([first, blank, blank, second].flatten)
    expect(entry.paragraphs).to eq([first, second])
  end
end
```

This works, but raises the next question, what if the entry starts or ends with one or more blank lines?

```ruby
context "blanks at beginning" do
  context "two" do
    it "returns one para" do
      blank = Line.new("")
      second = [Line.new("... safely stowed")]
      entry = Entry.new([blank, blank, second].flatten)
      expect(entry.paragraphs).to eq([second])
    end
  end
  context "one" do
    it "returns one para" do
      blank = Line.new("")
      second = [Line.new("... safely stowed")]
      entry = Entry.new([blank, second].flatten)
      expect(entry.paragraphs).to eq([second])
    end
  end
end
context "blanks at end" do
  context "one" do
    it "returns one para" do
      first = [Line.new("mind the gap...")]
      blank = Line.new("")
      entry = Entry.new([first, blank].flatten)
      expect(entry.paragraphs).to eq([first])
    end
  end
  context "two" do
    it "returns one para" do
      first = [Line.new("mind the gap...")]
      blank = Line.new("")
      entry = Entry.new([first, blank, blank].flatten)
      expect(entry.paragraphs).to eq([first])
    end
  end
end
```

The blanks at beginning checks already pass, coincidentally, because `#second_blank_line` will return true for any number of initial blank lines (because, for the first one, `result.last` is the outer empty array).  The blanks at end check fail.  It feels like it would be better (and not rely in a side-effect of `#second_blank_line`) to explicitly trim leading and trailing blank lines.  This works as a first pass:

```ruby
def paragraphs
  return [] if @lines.count == 0
  lines_trimmed.inject([[]]) do |result, line|
    build_next_result(result, line)
  end
end

private

def lines_trimmed
  trimmed = trim_initial_blank_lines(@lines)
  trim_initial_blank_lines(trimmed.reverse).reverse
end

def trim_initial_blank_lines(lines)
  lines.each_with_index do |l, index|
    next if l.text == ""
    return lines[index..-1]
  end
end
```

Looking at the implementation for Ruby’s [`String#split`](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/String.html#method-i-strip) (which is what we want here, except for objects, not characters), we see that it grabs the left and right offsets and returns the substring:

```ruby
loffset = lstrip_offset(str, start, start+olen, enc);
roffset = rstrip_offset(str, start+loffset, start+olen, enc);

if (loffset <= 0 && roffset <= 0) return rb_str_dup(str);
return rb_str_subseq(str, loffset, olen-loffset-roffset);
```

We can do that instead:

```ruby
def lines_trimmed
  start = first_non_blank_index(@lines)
  finish = first_non_blank_index(@lines.reverse)
  @lines[start..-(finish + 1)]
end

def first_non_blank_index(lines)
  lines.each_with_index do |l, index|
    return index if l.text != ""
  end
end
```

The tests still pass, and it feels better.
